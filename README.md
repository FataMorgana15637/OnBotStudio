# OnBotStudio
A simple plugin that allows programmers to compile code straight from Android Studio to the robot without building the entire app and over WI-FI.

## Installation
1. **Important:** Update Android Studio! If you have not installed or set up Android Studio for FTC, follow these [instructions](https://gm0.org/en/latest/docs/software/using-android-studio.html)
1. Download [OnBotStudio-1.0.jar](build/libs/OnBotStudio-1.0.jar)
1. Open Android Studio and open preferences
1. On the window that opens, click on *plugins*, then click the gear icon at the top of the page and select *install plugin from disk*
1. Select the file that we just downloaded and click open
1. The words *OnBotStudio* will now show up along the bottom of Android Studio, clicking on this will pull up the compiler

## Usage
In the bottom right corner, there is a blue wrench. Clicking this will run the OnBotJava compiling process, and the results will be printed in the console. The Wi-Fi must be connected to the robot in order for this to compile.
